##Description

This is a game I played a year ago I am replicating it as my final project in my CS120B class. I am using a Atmel AT1284 as my micro Controller.
The objective of the game is to memorize the sequence of which the led lights up. The game will get more trivial as the speed of the lights light
up as it will become faster and faster and there will be more leds to memorize.
